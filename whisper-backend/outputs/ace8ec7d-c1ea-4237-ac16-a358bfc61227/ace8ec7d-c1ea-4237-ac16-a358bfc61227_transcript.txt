[00:00 - 00:01] SPEAKER_00: Jessica, have I come in a bad time?
[00:03 - 00:05] SPEAKER_01: Gerald, this is Harvey Specter.
[00:07 - 00:07] SPEAKER_01: He's our best closer.
[00:08 - 00:12] SPEAKER_00: Says here that Cooper won't be staying on his honorary vice president.
[00:12 - 00:13] SPEAKER_03: That's right, I don't want him around.
[00:14 - 00:16] SPEAKER_00: He wouldn't be around. It's an honorary position.
[00:17 - 00:17] SPEAKER_03: I'll give a shit.
[00:19 - 00:24] SPEAKER_00: Well, I think you do, because that's just changed since I left, which means it's you who's been dealing in bad faith.
[00:24 - 00:28] SPEAKER_03: Well, now that you've got a grasp on what's happening that goddamn interim,
[00:28 - 00:31] SPEAKER_03: what are you going to do about it? Because he's not getting that title.
[00:32 - 00:34] SPEAKER_00: Well, let me make sure I understand this, okay?
[00:34 - 00:37] SPEAKER_00: We negotiated a deal that gave you everything you wanted.
[00:37 - 00:41] SPEAKER_00: Mr. Cooper signed it, and now you won't close until we take away the last shred of his dignity.
[00:42 - 00:42] SPEAKER_00: Bingo.
[00:43 - 00:44] SPEAKER_00: Well, that's not going to happen.
[00:44 - 00:44] SPEAKER_00: And why the hell not?
[00:45 - 00:48] SPEAKER_00: Because I like Mr. Cooper, and my firm doesn't operate in bad faith.
[00:49 - 00:50] SPEAKER_03: Oh, I see how it is.
[00:51 - 00:54] SPEAKER_03: Instead of working Cooper, you're working me.
[00:54 - 00:59] SPEAKER_03: Why don't you take your pansy attitude back in there and make him sign my deal?
[01:00 - 01:02] SPEAKER_03: Or I'll pay someone else your money to do it for me.
[01:03 - 01:07] SPEAKER_00: Well, first of all, Gerald, if you think anyone's going to touch this deal after your bad faith, you're mistaken.
