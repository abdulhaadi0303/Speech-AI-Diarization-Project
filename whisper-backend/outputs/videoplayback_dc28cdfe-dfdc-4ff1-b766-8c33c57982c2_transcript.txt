[00:00 - 00:04] SPEAKER_00: So a few weeks ago I was almost arrested at the Israel border control.
[00:04 - 00:07] SPEAKER_00: Let's talk about it. I was debating about not actually talking about this topic because
[00:08 - 00:13] SPEAKER_00: to be honest it was the most humiliating, degrading and scary experience of my entire life.
[00:13 - 00:18] SPEAKER_00: I'm fully aware that this video may get taken down and also my social media shut down.
[00:18 - 00:22] SPEAKER_00: But it's the topic we have to talk about and it's a topic that should be widely spoken about.
[00:23 - 00:27] SPEAKER_00: But before I get into the topic about me, we need to give some context about what actually is
[00:27 - 00:31] SPEAKER_00: happening, the truth about what is happening in this part of the world.
[00:31 - 00:36] SPEAKER_00: Since attacks heightened last year in 2021 and throughout 2022, I've seen countless reports
[00:36 - 00:43] SPEAKER_00: by news channels, not only news channels but huge news channels in a false way about what
[00:43 - 00:48] SPEAKER_00: truly is going on. Palestinians are facing daily bombardment from the apartheid state and one of
[00:48 - 00:54] SPEAKER_00: those bombardments is at the Al-Aqsa Mosque which is the third most holiest site in the Islamic faith.
[00:54 - 00:59] SPEAKER_00: Both in 2021 and during 2022, the apartheid state fired rubber bullets at people praying
[00:59 - 01:06] SPEAKER_00: within Al-Aqsa Mosque. These aren't just rubber bullets. These are steel bullets with just
[01:06 - 01:13] SPEAKER_00: a one centimeter thick rubber coating. That is enough to inflict humongous pain and also
[01:13 - 01:19] SPEAKER_00: will cause numerous hundreds of deaths. Zionism is Israel's national identity and
[01:19 - 01:26] SPEAKER_00: Zionists believe that Judaism is a nationality as well as a religion and Jews deserve a right to
[01:26 - 01:31] SPEAKER_00: belong to that ancestral home. Let's talk about the law of return. The law of return was passed
[01:31 - 01:38] SPEAKER_00: on the 5th of July in 1950 and it gives Jews the right to relocate and build homes in Israel.
[01:38 - 01:45] SPEAKER_00: Section 1 of the law to return declares that every Jew has the right to return to Israel as an
[01:45 - 01:50] SPEAKER_00: ola which means immigrant. They started building settlements after 1967 following a free
[01:50 - 01:57] SPEAKER_00: confiscation of land and who today take this land from Palestinians. The airport and all borders
[01:57 - 02:02] SPEAKER_00: are controlled by the apartheid state. Gaza is currently under siege which means it's an area
[02:02 - 02:07] SPEAKER_00: of two million people that can't escape. They are provoking and attacking residents in Sheikh Zula
[02:07 - 02:14] SPEAKER_00: which is a crucial area of land which Israelis want to take. When is this going to end? I
[02:14 - 02:19] SPEAKER_00: flew to Tel Aviv from Greece because I wanted to spend some of my Ramadan in this blessed part of
[02:19 - 02:25] SPEAKER_00: the world. I landed and then proceeded to border control where they then asked me to sit down to
[02:25 - 02:30] SPEAKER_00: answer a few questions. A few minutes later I was taken into the back room which is to the right
[02:30 - 02:36] SPEAKER_00: of the immigration where I was then proceeded to be interrogated, assaulted and verbally attacked
[02:36 - 02:42] SPEAKER_00: for the next six hours. So when you enter the room you are asked to sign a piece of paper which
[02:42 - 02:47] SPEAKER_00: basically means you are only speaking the truth the entire time which of course I sign. They asked
[02:47 - 02:51] SPEAKER_00: me questions about my previous relationships, explicit questions about my previous relationships,
[02:51 - 02:57] SPEAKER_00: my childhood and my religion. I then had to explain in depth my previous three years of traveling
[02:57 - 03:02] SPEAKER_00: in detail, exact dates, exact locations and exact people I've met throughout this entire time.
[03:03 - 03:08] SPEAKER_00: For me honestly I didn't have an issue with them asking me questions about my traveling,
[03:08 - 03:13] SPEAKER_00: I expected this from immigration but what I did not expect was six hours of persecution against
[03:13 - 03:19] SPEAKER_00: my faith, my childhood or my previous relationships. So six hours, six hours later after being
[03:19 - 03:28] SPEAKER_00: screened out, assaulted and attacked over the dumbest questions about my religion, especially my
[03:28 - 03:36] SPEAKER_00: religion. They were fixated upon my religion which I've honestly never experienced before and it
[03:36 - 03:40] SPEAKER_00: gave me a taste of what Muslims around the world truly experience border controls. They called
[03:40 - 03:46] SPEAKER_00: me a liar and continuously were asking me why I was hiding something so after six hours I have
[03:46 - 03:51] SPEAKER_00: had enough, I said to them I lay back in my chair and I said look I don't want to answer any more
[03:51 - 03:56] SPEAKER_00: of your questions these are the dumbest questions I've ever had to experience. Immigration had no
[03:56 - 04:00] SPEAKER_00: right to ask me about anything during my childhood, anything about my previous relationships, anything
[04:00 - 04:06] SPEAKER_00: like that and it was horrible, it was really really awful so after that I said look I've had enough
[04:06 - 04:12] SPEAKER_00: and I went and proceeded to book a flight and I left. What happened in that room I'm not going to
[04:12 - 04:17] SPEAKER_00: go into too much detail was traumatic, really really traumatic and the worst experience I've ever had
[04:17 - 04:24] SPEAKER_00: in my entire life and I never want anybody else in this world to experience why I went through, it was
[04:25 - 04:31] SPEAKER_00: really really awful and it's taking me three weeks now after it happened to even come on camera
[04:31 - 04:36] SPEAKER_00: and talk about it and this is also why I haven't uploaded onto this channel for a little while
[04:36 - 04:40] SPEAKER_00: because I honestly just haven't been that emotionally stable after it, it was really awful.
[04:41 - 04:49] SPEAKER_00: I almost went home just to rest and kind of get my headspace back to the original way because
[04:49 - 04:55] SPEAKER_00: it really, it's a me down to a place that I never ever want to go down to in ever, ever again.
[04:55 - 05:01] SPEAKER_00: Look this was one experience, one six hour experience I've had, I just, I can't even imagine
[05:01 - 05:07] SPEAKER_00: what it's like to experience that every single day to be living in this nightmare and to be
[05:07 - 05:14] SPEAKER_00: persecuted every single day with the fear of someone taking your land over, over nothing.
[05:14 - 05:22] SPEAKER_00: And I hope that in the future Palestinians can freely live their life that they want to live
[05:22 - 05:27] SPEAKER_00: without the fear of people taking their homes, violence or persecution. Palestine and with you
[05:27 - 05:31] SPEAKER_00: every single day you know that and it will continue to fight for this cause,
[05:32 - 05:35] SPEAKER_00: forever. Thank you for watching, see you in the next video.
